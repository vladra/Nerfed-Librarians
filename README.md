**The effects of the plugin are permanent and you will not be able to undo removal of enchanted books, so librarians will need to be reset after the plugin is removed.**

An extremely simple plugin with no commands, permissions, or configuration files.

New librarian trades will not include enchanted books. Existing librarians will also have their enchanted book trades removed. Other trades will not be affected.
